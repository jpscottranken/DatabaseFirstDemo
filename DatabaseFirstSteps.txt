0.	Create DatabaseFirst database using SQL Server Object Explorer.

1.	Open the SQL Server Object Explorer via the command:
	View / SQL Server Object Explorer

2.	Open the the Server named: (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB

3.	Right mouse-click on the Databases folder and
	choose the Add New Database option. For the name,
	choose DatabaseFirst.

4.	Verify that this worked. Shown in class.

5.	Right mouse-click on the new database and
	choose table/new table.

6.	In here, enter the following:

CREATE TABLE Employee (
	EmployeeID  INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
	FirstName 	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	LastName 	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	Address		VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	City		VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	StateCode	CHAR(2)		NOT NULL,
	Zip			VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	Phone		VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	DeptCode	INT			NOT NULL,
	Salary		DECIMAL(11,2) NOT NULL
);

7.	Open Visual Studio. Create a new Console project
	called DatabaseFirstDemo.

8.	Tools / NuGet Package Manager / Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...
	
	Click the Browse option. In the Search box, enter Entity Framework.
	
	Choose the EntityFramework one (on top for me) by single-clicking on it.
	
	Click in the Project checkbox (Will choose DBFirstDemo also).

	Click the Install button. Click OK. Click I Accept.
	
	Close NuGet. Then reopen it via the following:
	Tools / NuGet Package Manager / Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...
	go to Installed. Verify that EntityFramework has been loaded.
	Close NuGet.

	NOTE: The above can also be done via the following:
	
	Tools / NuGet Package Manager / Package Manager Console.
	From the command line, enter the following command:
	install-package Entity Framework

9.	In Visual Studio, right mouse-click on the Project
	Name. Choose Add. Choose New Item. Choose ADO.NET Entity Data Model
	Rename it EmployeeModel and click the Add button

	
	This opens up the Entity Data Model Wizard:
	From the Choose Model Contents, choose EF Designer from database and click the Next Button.
	
	From the Choose Your Connection, click the New Connection button. 
	
	From the Connection Properties, choose Microsoft SQL Server.
	For Server Name, enter (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB
	For Log on to the server, choose Use Windows Authentication.
	For Connect to a database, click down arrow, choose DatabaseFirst
	If desired, click the Test Connection button.
	Click the OK button.
	
	Back at the Choose Your Data Connect, verify that:
	Connection is set.
	Connection string is set.
	Save connection settings in App.Config as EmployeeEntities checked/set.
	Click the Next button.
	
	From the Choose Your Database Object and Settings /
	Which database objects do you want to include in your model?
	Choose the Tables / dbo / Employee checkbox.
	Click Finish.
	
	This brings up the EmployeeModel.edmx data model.
	This represents the conceptual model that displays the
	mapping between the database tables and the domain classes.

	In the Solution Explorer, open the EmployeeModel.edmx
	This is all designer created code.

	Open the EmployeeModel.edmx / EmployeeModelContext.cs file.
	Arrow down this file, find the following:
	public virtual DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }
	which represents the table.
	
	Open the EmployeeModel.tt folder and find the file:
	Employee.cs  This is the class file created.
	
10.	Go to the Program.cs file, and enter the following:

	//	Under the following: 
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		//	Enter the line below now.
		var context = new EmployeeEntities();
		var Employee1 = new Employee()
		{
			EmployeeID  = 1,
			FirstName 	= "Jeff",
			LastName 	= "Scott",
			Address		= "751 Parr Rd.",
			City		= "Wentzville",
			StateCode	= "MO",
			Zip			= "63385",
			Phone		= "(214) 386-3675",
			DeptCode	=	1,
			Salary		=	67890
		};
				
		var Employee2 = new Employee()
		{
			EmployeeID = 2,
			FirstName 	= "Evan",
			LastName 	= "Gudmestad",
			Address		= "4431 Finney Ave.",
			City		= "St Louis",
			StateCode	= "MO",
			Zip			= "63113",
			Phone		= "(214) 386-3991",
			DeptCode	=	2,
			Salary		=	78901
		};
		
		var Employee3 = new Employee()
		{
			EmployeeID  = 3,
			FirstName 	= "Charles",
			LastName 	= "Corrigan",
			Address		= "4431 Finney Ave.",
			City		= "St Louis",
			StateCode	= "MO",
			Zip			= "63113",
			Phone		= "(214) 386-4848",
			DeptCode	=	3,
			Salary		=	89012
		};
		
		context.Employees.Add(Employee1);
		context.Employees.Add(Employee2);
		context.Employees.Add(Employee3);
		context.SaveChanges();	
	}
	
11.	Save and run the program.

NOTE: No stored procedures. No SQLConnect(), etc.

12.	Go to Tables / dbo.Employee and choose to see Table Design.
	Go to Tables / dbo.Employee and choose to see Table 1st 1000 rows.
